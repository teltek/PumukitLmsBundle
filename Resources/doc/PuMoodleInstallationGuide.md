## Introduction

PumukitLmsBundle is a module created for Moodle allowing video embedding from Opencast and
PuMuKIT so that you can easily insert videos from those platforms in the courses created.

Follow the next steps to integrate Moodle with PuMuKIT.

## Modules

The module allow us to embed videos directly into the Moodle course as a resource.
* The 'PuMuKIT (Atto)' module will show the search page to list all the available videos and add them to the Moodle course.

### Modules installation

The process to install the module is as follows. The only difference will be the name of the '.zip' file that has to be uploaded to the Moodle platform.

*Note: To begin the installation, we need to have a Moodle administrator account.*

* Login on Moodle as administrator.

menu.
